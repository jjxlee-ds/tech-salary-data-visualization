# Tech Industry Compensation – Data Visualization & Storytelling (Python)

This project explores how experience, education, and demographics relate to total compensation in the U.S. tech industry using Python-based data visualization and statistical modeling. The goal of this project is to transform raw salary data into visual narratives that communicate real-world compensation patterns clearly and effectively.

## Dataset
- Tech Salaries 2017 (62,000+ self-reported U.S. tech workers)
- File: `techSalaries2017 (2).csv`

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Key Visual Insights
- Compensation increases strongly with years of experience, with growing variance at senior levels.
- Salary distribution is heavily right-skewed, highlighting extreme income inequality.
- Age follows a near-normal distribution, while income does not.
- Gender-based prediction using compensation alone shows severe class imbalance, limiting predictive validity.

## Methods Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Ridge & Lasso Regularization
- Logistic Regression
- Distribution Visualization (Histograms, Scatterplots)

## Files in This Repository
- `Python Data Visualization & Storytelling.pdf` – Full analysis and interpretations
- `techSalaries2017 (2).csv` – Dataset used for analysis

## Purpose of This Project
This project demonstrates my foundation in Python-based data visualization, data storytelling, and analytical reasoning. While this project is not web-based, I am actively extending these skills into front-end and interactive visualization frameworks.
